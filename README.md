# Animal Trading Card
A web-based trading card, from my knowledge of HTML and CSS, depicted of my favorite animal.
## _Notes_

---
- Used Udacity's starter code but implemented my own.
- CSS was used to scale and decorate the card and itâ€™s border.
- The result is a fully digital version of an animal trading card packed with interesting facts and statistics about the animal.
